# Flutter Draw-It Sample

An open source sample for Flutter and Gemini that uses multimodal
prompting to compare an image and word to see if they match.

## Getting Started

To use this sample, you'll need a Gemini API key. You can find instructions
for generating one at https://ai.google.dev/.

Before running the project locally, recreate its platform-specific subprojects
with this command:

```bash
flutter create --project-name flutter_draw_it_sample .
```
